# crud-app

it's a simple demo scraping app that has only one route property. 


There are mainly two features in the front end. 

### Feature One:

Users can scrape new property by name/state. If any result found individual property will be displayed as an individual form in the front end. The user then can attach photos and save those data into the database. Though scraped detail can't be modified in the form.


### Feature Two:

Users can search property by name/state/city. If any result found those results will be displayed in a table. Users can view each property detail on the details page.

This application has been developed using 

#### node.js , express for the backend
#### react.js for the frontend
#### mongodb as database
#### amazon s3 for storage

It has been deployed on an aws s3 instance
